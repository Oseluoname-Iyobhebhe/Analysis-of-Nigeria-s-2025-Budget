# Analysis-of-Nigeria-s-2025-Budget
In this project, I analyze Nigeria's 2025 budget, comparing capital expenditure across seven sectors (Works, Power, Health, Finance, Education, Defence, Agriculture) for 2025, 2024, and 2023. It includes structured data, visualizations, and trends to highlight fiscal priorities and sectoral investment changes.
